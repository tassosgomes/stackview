## 4. 🚨 Critical Issues Identified & Resolved

### ⚠️ Issue #1: Missing Workflow Call Triggers (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Main orchestration workflow couldn't call sub-workflows
```yaml
# BEFORE (Missing)
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

# AFTER (Fixed)
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  workflow_call:  # ← ADDED
```

**Resolution**: ✅ Added `workflow_call:` to backend.yml, frontend.yml, mcp.yml

### ⚠️ Issue #2: Deprecated GitHub Actions (HIGH)

**Problem**: Using deprecated actions that will stop working
```yaml
# BEFORE (Deprecated)
uses: actions/create-release@v1
uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1

# AFTER (Current)
uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
```

**Resolution**: ✅ Updated all deprecated actions to current versions

### ⚠️ Issue #3: Environment Context Issues (MEDIUM)

**Problem**: Environment variables set in steps not accessible in job conditions
```yaml
# BEFORE (Problematic)
if: env.UPDATES_FOUND == 'true'  # Context access error

# AFTER (Fixed)  
env:
  UPDATES_FOUND: 'false'  # Job-level declaration
```

**Resolution**: ✅ Fixed environment variable context access

### ⚠️ Issue #4: npm-check-updates Syntax (MEDIUM)

**Problem**: Command syntax may not produce parseable JSON
```bash
# BEFORE (Problematic)
ncu --format json > updates.json

# AFTER (Improved)
ncu --jsonUpgraded > updates.json 2>/dev/null
```

**Resolution**: ✅ Improved command reliability and error handling
